I am involved in the teaching and coordination of several courses at the  
[École Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique pour l’Industrie et l’Entreprise (ENSIIE)](https://www.ensiie.fr),  
covering topics related to computer networks, distributed systems, and software infrastructures.  
My teaching emphasizes both theoretical foundations and hands-on experimentation through lab sessions and student projects.

## 📘 Core Courses

### 1st & 2nd Year Engineering Program
- **Réseaux de données (Data Networks)**  
  Introduction to the layered network model (OSI/TCP-IP), addressing, subnetting, and routing mechanisms.  
  Includes practical sessions on IP configuration and network troubleshooting.

- **Programmation Réseaux (Network Programming)**  
  Implementation of client–server applications using sockets and network APIs.  
  Students learn to design and test basic communication protocols and automate network interactions through code.

- **Systèmes d'exploitation (Operating Systems)**  
  Concepts of processes, scheduling, synchronization, memory management, and shell scripting.  
  Practical sessions using Linux for process control, system calls, and script-based automation.

 - **Programmation impérative & langage C (Imperative Programming & C)**
   Introduction to imperative programming through the C language.
   Covers fundamental programming concepts, memory management, data structures, and modular design.
   Emphasis on problem solving and adopting an engineer's approach to software development.

- **Projet Informatique en C (C Programming Project)**
   Semester-long group programming project in C structured into multiple development milestones (lots).
   Students apply software engineering practices including modular design, memory management, testing, documentation, and version control.
   Introduction to tools such as Makefile, Doxygen, Valgrind, CUnit, GanttProject, and Git, followed by a substantial team-based implementation project emphasizing coordination and  collaborative development.

- **Network Virtualisation (Advanced Option)**  
  Fundamentals of virtualization, containers, and network function deployment.  
  Focus on SDN principles, controller–switch interaction, NFV placement, and orchestration tools.
